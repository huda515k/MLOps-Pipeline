# Alertmanager configuration for Grafana
# This file configures where alerts should be sent
# For now, alerts will be stored in Grafana's internal alerting system
# You can extend this to send to Slack, email, PagerDuty, etc.

# Note: In Grafana 9+, unified alerting is enabled by default
# Alerts can be configured to send notifications via:
# - Grafana UI: Alerting → Notification channels
# - Or via API/configuration files
